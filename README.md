{Scrabble Counting}
{Input a word and you will get the score for that word in Scrabble}, {8/11/15}

By {Aimee Reiss and Juliana Suzuki}

Description

We ask the user for a word. The word is then broken down into a char array. We used a double array to assign each letter in the alphabet the correct score in Scrabble. We then have the computer look at each character in the user's word and add the score's together. The final score is displayed.

Setup

We used build.gradle

Technologies Used

We used Java and Spark.
